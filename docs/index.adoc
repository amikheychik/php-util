== Subpackages

=== Generics

`Xtuple/Util/Generics` package simplifies work with generic classes.

==== Type

`Xtuple/Util/Generics/Type` package should be used when type check is required.

Use `StrictType` when instance of a class/interface is required.

[source]
----
use Xtuple\Util\Generics\Type\StrictType;

// Super types may be used.
$stdClass = new StrictType(\Countable::class);

// Type::cast() method returns the same object instance as it receives, if type is correct.
$array1 = new \ArrayObject();
// Passes correctly, as \ArrayObject implements \Countable
$array2 = $stdClass->cast($array1); // ($array1 === $array2)

// Throws an exception, as an array is passed
$stdClass->cast([]);

// Throws an exception, as \stdClass does not implement \Countable;
$stdClass->cast(new \stdClass());
----

Use `NullableType` when instance of a class/interface or null can be passed.

[source]
----
use Xtuple\Util\Generics\Type\NullableType;

// Class/interface names may be passed as strings.
$optionalStdClass = new NullableType('\stdClass'); <1>

// Returns null, instead of throwing an exception (unlike StrictType)
$optionalStdClass->cast(null);
----
<1> `::class` constant doesn't have a leading root namespace `\`, but it's recommended to provide one when it's passed as a string.
