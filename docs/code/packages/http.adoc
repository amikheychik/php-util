= HTTP

`Xtuple\Util\HTTP` package contains interfaces and classes to work with HTTP protocol
(currently, only `HTTP/1.1` is supported).
`Xtuple\Util\HTTP\Message`, `Xtuple\Util\HTTP\Request` and `Xtuple\Util\HTTP\Response` packages provide interfaces
and classes as close to HTTP protocol terms as possible,
while `Xtuple\Util\HTTP\Client` package provides an HTTP client to make requests.
