= Set

`Xtuple\Util\Collection\Set` package provides default set implementation.
As PHP doesn't support objects identity by default,
its implementation can be chosen by user
(two objects may be completely different,
but would be considered identical,
as long as their key method returns the same value).
This effectively makes Set similar to Map,
but unlike Map, Set throws exception when duplicates occur.
Set is immutable.
