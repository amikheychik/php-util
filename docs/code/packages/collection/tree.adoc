= Tree

`Xtuple\Util\Collection\Tree` package handles nested data
(but not necessarily using tree-representation to do it).
`Tree` is mutable and provides `set()` and `remove()` methods to change its state.
`Tree::data(): array` method returns all the data as a (nested) array.
`Tree` keys may be both strings or integers,
but all the specific data is retrieved using key paths to the node.
`Tree` is iterable,
but should iterate only through the top-level keys and elements
(as otherwise it's not clear how to cast nested keys to strings or integers.).
Similarly, `Tree::count()` returns the number of top-level data,
and `Tree::isEmpty()` doesn't check all the leaves.

As with other `Xtuple\Util\Collection` packages,
abstract `Tree` classes may be used implementing new interfaces
to provide custom method to access specific keys.
