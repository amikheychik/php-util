= Enum

`Xtuple\Util\Enum` package provides classes to simplify enums declaration.
Using enum classes instead of regular constants allows to have strictly checked types and values.
Each type of enum is based on an abstract class that checks available values through reflection.
Allowed values should declared as public constants.
