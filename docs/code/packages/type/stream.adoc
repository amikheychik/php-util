= Stream

`Xtuple\Util\Type\Stream` package provide classes to work with PHP streams (resources).
As of PHP 7.1, `resource` keyword can not be used as a type hint,
and resources themselves are very generic,
may represent very different types
(e.g. resource handler created by `curl_init()`
and resource created by `tmpfile()` are different).
`Stream` package defines the direction to specify and handle different resource types.
